# Python
Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December
1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable
of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.

# Why Python?
 - Open Source
 - Amazing Community
 - Short Learning Curve
 - General Purpose Language

# Libraries for Data Science
 - [Numpy](http://numpy.org)
 - [Pandas](http::/pandas.pydata.org)
 - [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
 - [Seaborn](http://seaborn.org)
 - [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)

# Conclusion
Python is an excellent language for rapid testing and prototyping.
However, your tools should suit what *you* want to do with them, so it
may/may not be right for *you*.

### **TL;DR:** Give it a try, see what you think!
